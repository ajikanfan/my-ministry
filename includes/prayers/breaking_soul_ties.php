  <h2 class="prayer_title">Breaking of soul ties</h2>
  <div class="prayer_copy">
    <p>Heavenly Father, in the Name of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> I submit my soul, desires and emotions to the Holy Spirit.</p><p>I confess to you all of my promiscuous premarital sexual relationships, as well as all sexual relationships outside of marriage as sin. I also confess all ungodly spiritual, soul-ish or fleshly bondage as sin.</p>
    <p>I thank you that you have forgiven me, and cleansed me of all unrighteousness through the blood of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span>. I thank you that you have given me the keys to your kingdom, and spiritual authority. What I bind will be bound, and what I loose will be loosed.</p>
    <p>In the Name of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span>, I ask you to free me from all soul ties with previous sexual partners, and ungodly relationships. Holy Spirit please pull out all these roots, and tentacles of sexual bondage. Cut off the roots of the tree, emotional dependencies, lusts and addictions.</p>
    <p>I bind, renounce and rebuke any demons that are strengthening these soul ties, or that I received through past sexual encounters.</p>
    <p>I cancel all of your assignments against me in the Name of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> and I declare your bondage broken in my life. I will not allow you in my life any further.</p>
    <p>I now wield the sword of the Spirit against you and cut off the soul ties between me and the following people...</p>
    <p>Father I pray that you will take away all memories that I have of these ungodly unions that I may be free to give my soul fully to you and my partner.</p>
    <p>Father I accept your forgiveness for all past sexual sins, and I believe that I have been totally forgiven, and that I am cleansed of all unrighteousness.</p>
    <p>I now dedicate myself to you, please keep me holy in soul, spirit and body by your grace. To you belong all the honour and the glory in <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> name.</p>
    <p>Amen</p>
