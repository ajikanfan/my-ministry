  <h2 class="prayer_title">Prayer to renounce familiar Spirits</h2>
  <div class="prayer_copy">
    <p><span class="jesus">Lord Jesus Christ</span>, I belong to you and you have saved me with your precious Blood. I need no other spirits in my life, except the Holy Spirit of God. Please forgive me today for accepting any help, guidance, comfort or information from any other spirits. Lord I also choose now to renounce all spirits that have come down my family line and are still in any way influencing my life. I also lay down and renounce any and all "gifts" or abilities that I have received from these spirits, and I command all such gifting that didn't originate from God to leave me now.</p>
    <p>Holy Spirit, You have been sent by God the Father to teach, equip, comfort and guide me in Gods ways. I desperately need you in every area of my life. As Satan's counterfeit gifting releases me, I ask that You would fill me in the areas that they once influenced.</p>
    <p>Satan, today I choose to stand firm in the victory that <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> gained over you on my behalf. I take authority over every spirit that came down my bloodline from my ancestors. In the mighty name of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> Christ my Lord and Saviour I now command those spirits to leave me. <strong>Leave now!</strong></p>
