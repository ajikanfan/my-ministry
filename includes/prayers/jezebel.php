  <h2 class="prayer_title">Prayer for release from Jezebel</h2>
  <div class="prayer_copy">
    <p>Father, I come to you in the name of <span class="jesus">Jesus Christ</span> the Shepard of my soul.  I confess and renounce the sin in my life through which I manipulated, dominated and controlled other people.</p>
    <p>I hate, renounce and reject the defeated Jezebel spirit and claim my victory against it in the name of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> <a href="#" target="_blank">(Ps. 139)</a>.
    <p>Because <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> died for me on the cross, and became a curse on my behalf I now declare that every curse of Jezebel is broken up to seven generations before me on both sides of my family.</p>
    <p>Father I also ask you to break any ties that I might still have with those that practice witchcraft against me.
    <p>Above all Lord please help me to fully submit my life to you.</p>
    <p><span class="jesus">Jesus</span> said, "They that believe in me will cast out devils".</p>
    <p>I believe in <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> therefore I can take authority over every demon associated with Jezebel and <strong>command them to go from me in <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> name!</strong></p>
    <p>Amen</p>
