  <h2 class="prayer_title">Prayer for the release from curses</h2>
  <div class="prayer_copy">
    <p><span class="jesus">Lord Jesus Christ</span>, I believe that you are the Son of God and the only way to God, that you died on the cross for all my sins, and that you rose again from the dead. I acknowledge you as my saviour.</p>
    <p>I confess you as my Lord and by your grace Lord I mean to follow you and to obey you. I confess Lord any sin in my life and any sins of my ancestors and I trust you for forgiveness.</p>
    <p>Also by decision of my will, I forgive every other person who has ever harmed me, or wronged me. I forgive them all now as I would have you forgive me. I lay down all bitterness, hatred, resentment and rebellion.</p>
    <p>Lord <span class="jesus">Jesus</span>, you know any dark shadow over my life, any curse that came over my ancestors or has opened me up, or is upon my family line. Lord <span class="jesus">Jesus</span>, I believe that you were made a curse for me on the cross that I may be redeemed from the curse and enter into the blessings.</p>
    <p>In order to do this Lord I renounce any contact with Satan and with occult power whether by myself or my ancestors or others related to me. I also commit myself to cleanse my home of any object that honours Satan or dishonors <span class="jesus">Jesus Christ</span>.</p>
    <p>And now Lord, on the basis of my confession, and on the authority of your Word, and in the Name of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> I loose myself and those related to me from any curse that has been over me, and by faith Lord I now thank you for that release.</p>
    <p>Amen</p>
