    <p>Lord <span class="jesus">Jesus Christ</span>, I believe that you are the Son of God, and the only way to God. I also believe that you died on the cross and laid down your life for all sinners. Lord, today I confess to You that I am a sinner, and that I have sinned against you. Lord please have mercy on me and forgive me all of my sins. Today I accept your selfless sacrifice on the cross on my behalf, and I accept You as my Lord and Saviour. Lord I invite You today to come and live in my heart, and I give You my life. I thank You now for Your forgiveness Lord, and from this day I choose to live for you.</p>
    <p>Amen</p>
