  <h2 class="prayer_title">Breaking sexual bondage</h2>
  <div class="prayer_copy">
    <p>Father I confess today that I was involved in sexual sin.  I specifically confess the following things (name them).
    <p>I claim my freedom in body, soul and spirit from all sexual bondage and stand on God's promise that whoever calls on <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> will be set free <a href="#" target="_blank">(Joel 2:32)</a>.</p>
    <p>Lord you have promised that if I confess my sins you will forgive me and cleanse me of all unrighteousness <a href="#" target="_blank">(1 John 1:9)</a>.  I therefore accept your forgiveness and cleansing.</p>
    <p>Satan, I reject you in the name of <span class="jesus">Jesus Christ</span>.  I take back every area of my mind and body that previously belonged to you.  I claim my freedom specifically in the area of sexual sin, and reject and renounce all sexual demons in my life. <strong>I command these demons to leave me now!</strong></p>
    <p>Amen</p>
