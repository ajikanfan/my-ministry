    <p>Thank you <span class="jesus">Lord Jesus</span> that you have died for my sins.</p>
    <p>Thank you <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> for your glorious resurrection, and that you have made me a new creature through my faith in the cleansing power of your precious blood.</p>
    <p><span class="jesus">Lord Jesus</span>, I confess the following before you today:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I sought supernatural experiences that were outside of your will, and I was disobedient to your Word.</li>
      <li>I ask you Lord to help me to renounce these things, and to heal me in body, soul and spirit in <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> mighty name.</li>
      <li>I renounce all witchcraft and sorcery, both black and white.</li>
      <li>I renounce the ouija board, playing with "glassy", book and key, dungeons and dragons and all other occultic games.</li>
      <li>I renounce all spiritualistic sessions, clairvoyance, and all spiritualistic mediums.</li>
      <li>I renounce ESP, second sight and all mind reading.</li>
      <li>I renounce all forms of fortune telling, palm reading, crystal balls, card reading etc.</li>
      <li>I renounce all interest and contact with astrology and horoscopes.</li>
      <li>I renounce reincarnation, and all contact with divination healing groups.</li>
      <li>I renounce hypnotism under any circumstances.</li>
      <li>I renounce all interest in the past, or the future that is outside of your will.</li>
      <li>I renounce dowsing, devil worship and automatic writing.</li>
      <li>I also renounce all literature that I have read in the above mentioned areas.</li>
      <li>I now break in the name of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> all hereditary demonic influence over my family line due to my ancestors involvement in any of the above mentioned areas.</li>
      <li>I renounce every cult that renounces the Blood of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span>.</li>
      <li>I renounce every philosophy that questions the divinity of Christ, or that renounces the Holy Spirit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I now call on the name of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> to set me free!</p>
    <p>Lord I have another confession to make: I have harboured bitterness and resentment towards others.</p>
    <p>Lord, please help me now to forgive them: I now choose to forgive the following people... & I also forgive myself!</p>
    <p>I now renounce all evil spirits that are tormenting me, and <strong>I command you to leave me now in the name of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span>!</strong></p>
