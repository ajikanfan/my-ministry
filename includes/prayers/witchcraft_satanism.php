  <h2 class="prayer_title">Prayer to renounce witchcraft or Satanism</h2>
  <div class="prayer_copy">
    <p>I renounce all vows or oaths that I made or were made on my behalf at the altar of Satan whether known or unknown to me in the name of <span class="jesus">Jesus Christ</span>.  <span class="jesus">Lord Jesus</span>, I ask you today to please destroy every contract or oath or vow or ritual that I partook of whether through Satanism, witchcraft, the occult or spiritism through your precious blood.  I believe in your death and resurrection on the cross, and I pray that your victory over Satan on the cross would become my victory over Satan to defeat all his power in my life.</p>
    <p>I renounce all inherited curses of spirits affecting me through my ancestor's involvement in witchcraft and pray that the Lord <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> would cleanse my bloodline through his precious blood.  I nail all these things to the cross.</p>
    <p>Because of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span>' blood Satan has no more power over me or my family.  I renounce him and all his demons and declare them my enemies.  In <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> name I take up my Godly authority and expel all evil spirits thereby destroying completely all their power in my life.</p>
    <p>In the name of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> I remove all Satan's right to influence me or my kids from this moment on. <b>In <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> authority I bind all demons in my life and command them to go to where the Holy Spirit sends them!</b></p>
    <p>Father in the name of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> I pray that you would close every doorway that I ever opened to Satan through sin in my life.  Please shut them through the blood of <span class="jesus">Jesus</span>.  I thank you for this in <span class="jesus">Jesus</span> name.</p>
    <p>I place my past behind me, and choose God's future for my life from this day forward.</p>
    <p>Amen</p>
