<h2 class=post_title>Put On Your New Self</h2>
<img src="images/pexels-photo-540518.jpeg" class=main_post_img alt="main post image">
<p>I believe in preaching a simple message. I don’t believe in complicating <span class=jesus>God</span>’s word. My pastor preaches a simple message and I always endevour to preach a simple message as well, because <span class=jesus>Jesus</span> also preached a simple gospel. My message today is called ‘Put on the New Self’. This message is for anyone who thinks that it is too late for them, this message is for anyone who thinks they have run out of time, or anyone who has given up.</p>
<p>When you decide to live for <span class=jesus>Jesus</span>, it means that give him every single of your life, without reservation or restraint. It means you give him complete control and carte blanche. Now carte blanche is defined as; unrestricted power to act at one's own discretion; unconditional authority. That is why I want to teach you how to walk every single day with <span class=jesus>Jesus</span>. Being dedicated to <span class=jesus>Jesus</span> means that you have confidence he is in control. Walking with <span class=jesus>Jesus</span> means that I spend time in my prayer closet. A prayer closet doesn’t necessarily have to be a closet or cupboard, but it is somewhere were you go, shut out the hustle and bustle of everyday life and spend time alone with <span class=jesus>God</span>. You spend time alone with your maker and you believe that when you go to <span class=jesus>Jesus</span> that he will talk  to you and he will minister to you. Then you can you say to people, “I have a place where I go, I talk to <span class=jesus>God</span> and he gives me peace and helps me carry all my burdens”.</p>
<p>So when I walk with <span class=jesus>Jesus</span> daily, and I am dedicated to him, because I have walked with him through the good times and the bad, because I know what his bible says, and his bible is in my mind and on my lips (that means we speak it everyday) when I am in trouble I know that I don’t have to worry because <span class=jesus>Jesus</span> is with me.</p>
<p>Because I know <span class=jesus>Jesus</span> is so big to me he encompasses my field of vision and everything that I see, so that I can’t see my problems anymore, all I can see is <span class=jesus>Jesus</span>!</p>
<p>But how I do get to that place with <span class=jesus>Jesus</span>? Number 1; read your bible everyday. Whenever you don’t read the word of <span class=jesus>God</span>, your day will go wrong and you will struggle and suffer. That is because when you read <span class=jesus>God</span>’s word it protects your mind, as you read <span class=jesus>God</span>’s word it is actually filling your spirit.</p>
<p>Number 2; I pray. A Christian that can’t pray is a Christian that has no power! Prayer is the bread and butter of walk with <span class=jesus>God</span>. Where ever you go, sing praise songs, pray in tongues, pray to <span class=jesus>God</span>. That means whenever you are faced with a challenging situation your first instinct must be to pray.</p>
<p>Number 3; you share what <span class=jesus>God</span> has done for you, wherever you go. I want you to know that if you want <span class=jesus>God</span> to give you a better testimony, share what <span class=jesus>God</span> has done for you wherever you go and don’t stop. If you don’t share your testimony, the devil will steal your miracle from you!</p>
<p><span class=jesus>God</span>’s kingdom is like a slow bake oven. It takes time. Things don’t happen over night. I am not saying that they do, but you have to work at it and be consistent.</p>
<p><span class=jesus>God</span> has been touching many, people here and many people have been receiving miracles, but <span class=jesus>God</span> expects you to remember what he has done for you during the tough times and to use your testimony to win souls for the kingdom.</p>
<p>If you can do these three things, I promise you <span class=jesus>God</span> will turn your life around and do a very special thing for you!</p>
<p class=verse>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of <span class=jesus>God</span>. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in <span class=jesus>God</span>. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.<a href="#">Colossians 3:1-3 (KJV)</a></p>
